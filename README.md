# Nice Tool Kit

A toolkit for my personal use.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nicetoolkit
```
## Versioning

This project uses automatic versioning in format `YYYY.MM.PATCH`:
- Version is automatically bumped when commits are pushed to master
- Year and month are updated based on current date
- Patch number increases for multiple commits in same month
